Architectury API is an **optional** intermediary library which mods may utilize to ease developing multiplatform mods.

## What is Architectury API
Architectury API is an API to abstract calls to Fabric API and Forge API as both loaders have different implementations and interfaces.

Architectury updates regularly, with new hooks and features. Currently contains over 80 events hooks, networking abstraction, loader calls abstraction, game registry abstraction and more.
